Project Title - Moodz

Project Description - Our project is a React-based CRUD web application which gives users the possibility to collect music playlists according to different moods in their everyday lives. They can either check out one of our curated playlists (Discover) or create their own (My Playlists).

Features - Through a search bar in our My Playlists page, users are able to look up songs fetched from the AudioDB API (see link below), create a playlist with a title of their choosing and save the song to said list. They can also rename or delete the playlist, as well as remove songs from it. To get some inspiration, they can also explore pre-made playlists for different moods in our Discover page. The layout is responsive for laptop, tablet and mobile devices.

Technologies and tools - React.js, CSS, Figma, Trello, VS Code

Contributions - We are a team of 4 students at Hyper Island who contributed to this project

Amanda Ljung - me and Sergio collaborated on the design ideation. Further I worked on the “My Playlists” page, creating the search component and functions to collect and display the API data. Me and Sergio also cooperated on the useContext component to use a variety of functions globally. 

Sergio Prin - I worked on the design ideation together with Amanda and built it in Figma. I also contributed to the “My Playlists” page, creating a modal to be able to add a song to a new or existing playlist. I worked on the functionality to display lists once they are created, as well as rename and delete them. Lastly, I collaborated with Amanda on useContext as mentioned above.  

Vijaya Natarajan - I contributed to this project by fetching the API, displaying it in the “Discover” page and making it responsive. I also did the file structuring and the routing for the nav-bar and handled the git merging, as well as deployed the website using Netlify.

Zahra Joneydi - I developed the “Homepage” of the project, which includes the header, footer, hero section (with an image and description), a call-to-action section, and a mood section. The entire layout is fully responsive.
